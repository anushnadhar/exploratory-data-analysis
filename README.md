Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

## About the Project

This project examines commute patterns and speed variations for a professional residing in a European suburb. The analysis utilizes a self-recorded dataset containing door-to-door travel speeds for daily train commutes (morning and evening) and weekend cycling trips along a parallel 10-mile route. The study aims to identify commute speed patterns, explore the impact of factors such as train headways and elevation changes, and compare the efficiency of train and bike travel. Insights from this analysis can provide a deeper understanding of commuting dynamics and potential optimizations.

In this project, we will conduct exploratory data analysis, perform feature engineering, group the data, and create visualizations that effectively integrate graphics and text.

## Analysis Techniques Used

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** is the initial step where you explore a dataset to understand its underlying structure and features. The goal is to:

* Summarize key statistics (e.g., mean, median, mode, standard deviation) to understand data distribution.
* Identify data types and patterns, such as categorical vs. numerical variables and trends.
* Detect anomalies or missing data, which could affect analysis outcomes.
* Visualize relationships between variables using plots (e.g., scatter plots, histograms, box plots).

## Findings and Insights

-**Commute Patterns:**

Weekdays: Train used for a 10-mile commute.
Weekends: Cycling used for the same 10-mile route.

-**Speed Variations:**

Average monthly speed is higher on weekdays (train) than on weekends (cycling).
Weekends show higher variability in speed due to elevation and weather conditions.

-**Efficiency:**

Despite a lower average speed, the same 10-mile distance is traveled in less time on weekends.

-**Percentage Changes:**

Positive values indicate increased average speed from the previous month.
Negative values indicate decreased average speed.
Percentage change is greater on weekends compared to weekdays.
